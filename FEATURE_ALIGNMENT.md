## Conclusion

Phase 4 successfully established a solid foundation for production development:

1. **Technical Debt Eliminated**: All linting issues resolved, quality gates
   established
2. **Documentation Aligned**: Realistic status reporting, no more
   feature-documentation mismatches
3. **Testing Enhanced**: 95% coverage target, comprehensive test suites
4. **Process Improved**: Automated quality assurance, performance monitoring

The project is now ready for Phase 5 implementation with:

- Clear understanding of what works vs. what needs completion
- Robust development process and quality assurance
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Accurate documentation and status reporting

**Next Priority**: Begin Phase 5 core feature completion to achieve the
remaining 5% for production readiness. Focus on fixing runtime issues in the 9
partially working examples, particularly variable scoping and complex parsing
edge cases.
