# SomonScript Production Readiness Report

**Assessment Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Current Version:** v0.3.36  
**Production Readiness:** **65-70%** Complete  
**Estimated Time to Production:** **4-6 weeks**

## Executive Summary

SomonScript's core language features are **complete and functional**, but the
system lacks critical operational hardening required for production deployment.
While the compiler successfully handles Tajik Cyrillic syntax and generates
JavaScript, several infrastructure and reliability issues must be addressed
before production use.

## 🔴 Critical Blockers (Week 1-2)

These issues **MUST** be fixed before any production deployment:

### 1. **No Mandatory Production Mode**

- **Issue:** Safety features (circuit breakers, metrics, validators) are
  optional
- **Impact:** System can run in unsafe configuration in production
- **Fix:** Implement `--production` flag that enforces all safety features

### 2. **Non-Deterministic Builds**

- **Issue:** `process.cwd()` usage in 2 files breaks build reproducibility
- **Files:** `cli/program.ts`, `module-resolver.ts`
- **Impact:** Same source produces different outputs in different environments
- **Fix:** Replace with stable, relative paths

### 3. **Test Failures**

- **Issue:** 5 tests failing (resource-limiter, async operations)
- **Coverage:** Current 75%, Target 80%+, CLI only 47%
- **Impact:** Unknown bugs in production
- **Fix:** Debug and fix failing tests, increase coverage

### 4. **No Graceful Shutdown**

- **Issue:** Resources not properly cleaned up on termination
- **Impact:** Memory leaks, corrupted state, hanging processes
- **Fix:** Implement global shutdown handler for all resources

### 5. **No Failure Mode Testing**

- **Missing Tests:**
  - Circular dependency handling
  - File permission errors
  - Memory leak detection
  - Corrupted file handling
  - Long-running stability
- **Fix:** Add comprehensive failure scenario tests

## 🟡 High Priority Issues (Week 3-4)

### Resource Management

- **No compilation timeouts** - Can hang indefinitely
- **No memory limits** - Can exhaust system memory
- **No file size limits** - Vulnerable to large inputs
- **No AST depth limits** - Stack overflow risk

### Module System

- **Bundler bypasses type checking** - Generated bundles may have type errors
- **Module resolution uses `fs.watch()`** - Should use chokidar for reliability
- **No module dependency cycle detection** - Can cause infinite loops

### Observability

- **Health endpoints not exposed** - `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics` exist but
  no HTTP server
- **No structured logging** - Difficult to debug in production
- **No correlation IDs** - Can't trace requests through system
- **No performance metrics** - Can't detect degradation

## 🟢 Existing Strengths

The following production features are **already implemented**:

- ✅ **Circuit Breakers** - Prevent cascading failures
- ✅ **Error Aggregator** - Collects all errors before reporting
- ✅ **Production Validator** - Validates environment requirements
- ✅ **Metrics Collection** - Tracks system performance
- ✅ **Module Registry** - Manages dependencies
- ✅ **Resource Limiter** - Basic resource management (needs enhancement)
- ✅ **890/895 tests passing** - Good test foundation
